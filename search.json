    "text": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the primary greenhouse gases responsible for global warming and climate change. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels for transportation, energy production, and industrial processes, have led to a significant increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. As a result, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by over 40% since the pre-industrial era.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n#show which data set I used\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/emissions/emissions.csv')\n\n#make sure data is clean from unwanted values\ndf_co2 = df.loc[df['Emissions.Type.CO2'] > 0]\ndf_co2_year = df_co2.groupby('Year').sum()['Emissions.Type.CO2']\n\n#make a simple plot\nplt.plot(df_co2_year.index, df_co2_year.values)\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('CO2 Emissions (metric tons)')\nplt.title('CO2 Emissions by Year')\nplt.show()\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_337/3488832510.py:8: FutureWarning: The default value of numeric_only in DataFrameGroupBy.sum is deprecated. In a future version, numeric_only will default to False. Either specify numeric_only or select only columns which should be valid for the function.\n  df_co2_year = df_co2.groupby('Year').sum()['Emissions.Type.CO2']\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by over 40% since the pre-industrial era.\nThe effects of CO2 emissions are felt all around the world though. Effects are seen through rising temperatures, more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms, and sea-level rise. These changes are affecting ecosystems, wildlife, and human societies in various ways, with severe consequences for food production, water supply, health, and security.\nHowever, the impacts of CO2 emissions are not evenly distributed, and the most vulnerable populations, particularly in lower-income countries, are disproportionally affected. This is because they often lack the resources, technology, and infrastructure to adapt to the changing climate and mitigate its effects. Moreover, many of these countries have contributed only a small fraction of the total CO2 emissions historically, yet they are bearing the brunt of the damage.\nOn the other hand, more developed countries, such as the United States, China, and the European Union, are responsible for a significant share of the global CO2 emissions. The high levels of emissions are due to their high consumption of energy and resources, which has enabled them to enjoy a higher standard of living. However, this also means that their emissions have a disproportionate impact on the environment and the global climate.\nIf everyone in the world produced as much CO2 emissions as the more developed countries do now, the consequences would be catastrophic. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would increase rapidly, causing temperatures to rise by several degrees Celsius. This would lead to a cascade of impacts, including more frequent and severe extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and widespread ecological disruptions. The most vulnerable populations would be hit the hardest, with massive food shortages, water scarcity, and forced migration.\nThis project will focus on where the CO2 emmissions are coming from currently, and what corelations are involved, the main factor being technology. The question is at the rate we are going now, will we have to choose between developement and the envirnment at some point?\n\n\n\nFor this project I used 4 interesting data sets which I show below. Three are from the corgis dataset website which all based on co2 emmissions and world developement. The last one is from the kaggle database, which is basically a better data seto of each country in the world.\n\nimport pandas as

I was surprised to see it was a very linear upward trend which is exactly what I expected.\nThen I wanted to see a breakdown of where the co2 emmissions are coming from. An easy way for me to do that was just look at the US for an example. The data included cement, coal, gas and oil so i wanted to look at a visual for a comparison.\nGetting into my topic, I was curious to see which countries had the most emmissions and which had the lowest. I decided to do a bar chart to show both of these because it is more clear to see. I made two bar plots you will see later on that show the top 10 highest and lowest countries that produce the most emmissions.\nI was also curious to see which countries had the most technology because I wanted to see if there was possibly a correlation between tech and co2 emissions. I made the plot below and it shows that they do match some of the countries in the top 10 emmissions.\nFrom here, I wanted to see if the co2 emmissions had anything to do with developement. There was a section in the data that measured the rates of developement and I plotted the top 4 out of curiosity.\nAnother good visual for this project was the use of maps and geopandas. I thought it would be a good way to visually look at a side to side comparison based on the contours. First I started with an easy visual of co2 emmissions. The darker the red, the more the country produces.\nThen I made a map of telephone lines per a certain number of people. It is hard to quantify tech in general, so I just narrowed in on one type of tech that is already accounted for was an easy substitute.\nThen I wanted to make a map of wealth for a third comparison to solidify my point. I wanted to make this map interactive so i used potly.express and it looks alot nicer than the other two. You can hober over each boundry and see the actual dollar amount.\nThese all had some interesting results that I would say definataley shows a coorelation in emmissions to wealth and technology. From here I was able to make assumptions that further proved my theory and gives us something to think about going foreward.\n\n\n\nIn the first image shown above, it is clear to see CO2 emmisions around the entire world has gone up linearly since the 1970’s. This is due to the increase of the useof technologies around the world from cars, to electricity in homes, to transportation and more. CO2 emissions are a major contributor to climate change, and they are primarily generated through the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, gas, cement, and oil. In this context, it is important to understand how each of these sources emits CO2 and the impact they have on the environment. In the US we can break down these emmissions to see the largest contributors.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/global_emissions/global_emissions.csv')\n\n# Select a specific country\ncountry = 'United States'\ndf_country = df[df['Country.Name'] == country]\n\n# Group the data by year and sum the emissions from different sources\ndf_year = df_country.groupby('Year')[['Emissions.Production.CO2.Cement', 'Emissions.Production.CO2.Coal',\n                                      'Emissions.Production.CO2.Gas', 'Emissions.Production.CO2.Oil']].sum()\n\n# Plot the line chart\ndf_year.plot(kind='line', figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.title(f'CO2 Emissions from different sources in {country}')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('CO2 Emissions (metric tons)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the image above, you can see it can be broken down cement, coal, gas and oil. Here’s how each of them emits CO2:\nCoal: Coal is a fossil fuel that is burned to generate electricity or heat. When coal is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The amount of CO2 emitted depends on the quality of coal and the combustion technology used.\nGas: Natural gas is a fossil fuel that is often used for heating and electricity generation. When natural gas is burned, it releases carbon dioxide and water vapor. The amount of CO2 emitted depends on the efficiency of the combustion process and the type of gas used.\nCement: Cement is a primary component of concrete, and it is produced by heating limestone and other materials in a kiln. This process releases large amounts of carbon dioxide due to the chemical reaction between the limestone and the heat.\nOil: Oil is another fossil fuel that is commonly used for transportation and energy production. When oil is burned, it releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The amount of CO2 emitted depends on the type of oil and the efficiency of the combustion process.\nOverall, the combustion of fossil fuels releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. It is essential to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and transition towards cleaner sources of energy, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, to mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\n\nThe top countries in terms of CO2 emissions are China, the United States, and India. These countries are also some of the largest and most technologically advanced in the world.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/global_emissions/global_emissions.csv')\n\n# Select a specific year\nyear = 2018\ndf_year = df[df['Year'] == year]\n\n# Sort the data by total CO2 emissions\ndf_sorted = df_year.sort_values(by='Emissions.Production.CO2.Total', ascending=False)\n\n# Select the top 10 countries\ndf_top10 = df_sorted.head(10)\n\n# Plot the bar chart\nplt.bar(df_top10['Country.Name'], df_top10['Emissions.Production.CO2.Total'])\nplt.title(f'Top 10 Countries with highest CO2 Emissions in {year}')\nplt.xlabel('Country')\nplt.ylabel('CO2 Emissions (metric tons)')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nChina is the world’s largest emitter of CO2, accounting for over a quarter of global emissions. Its emissions are largely driven by its reliance on coal as a primary energy source, as well as its massive industrial sector, which produces a significant amount of greenhouse gases.\nThe United States is the second-largest emitter of CO2, accounting for around 15% of global emissions. Its emissions are also driven by its use of fossil fuels, particularly in the transportation and electricity sectors.\nIndia is the third-largest emitter of CO2, accounting for around 7% of global emissions. Its emissions are largely driven by its rapidly growing economy, which is heavily reliant on coal-fired power plants and transportation infrastructure.\nIn terms of technology, these countries are also leaders in many areas. The high levels of CO2 emissions in these countries are partly a result of their reliance on fossil fuels for energy, but they are also driven by their large and rapidly growing economies.\n\n\n\nThese countries are attempting to reduce emmissions, but they havent been able to do enough to impact the linear upward trend yet. The problem is that the effects off these emmissions dont just affect the countries that produce the most, it affects everyone. Below are a list of the countries with the lowest emmissions.\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/global_emissions/global_emissions.csv')\n\n# Select a specific year\nyear = 2018\ndf_year = df[df['Year'] == year]\n\n# Sort the data by total CO2 emissions\ndf_sorted = df_year.sort_values(by='Emissions.Production.CO2.Total', ascending=True)\n\n# Select the top 10 countries\ndf_bottom10 = df_sorted.head(10)\n\n# Plot the bar chart\nplt.bar(df_bottom10['Country.Name'], df_bottom10['Emissions.Production.CO2.Total'])\nplt.title(f'Bottom 10 Countries with lowest CO2 Emissions in {year}')\nplt.xlabel('Country')\nplt.ylabel('CO2 Emissions (metric tons)')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nGlobal warming, which refers to the long-term increase in Earth’s average surface temperature, has a wide range of impacts on the world. Countries that are producing thousands of metric tons are hurting the people listed above whom only produce a few metric tons in comparison. Here are some of the ways that global warming affects the planet, no matter what country we live in or how much you produce:\n\nClimate patterns: As the planet’s temperature rises, it affects climate patterns in various regions. This can lead to more extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, and hurricanes, as well as changes in precipitation patterns and sea level rise.\nEcosystems: Global warming can have significant impacts on ecosystems, including changes in species distribution, biodiversity loss, and alterations in plant and animal life cycles. These changes can also affect food chains and ecosystems’ ability to provide important services, such as clean air and water.\nHuman health: Rising temperatures can also have negative impacts on human health, such as an increase in heat-related illnesses, infectious diseases spread by insects, and air pollution.\nEconomic impacts: Global warming can also have significant economic impacts, such as damage to infrastructure and property from extreme weather events, loss of crops and productivity, and displacement of populations due to sea level rise and other environmental changes.\nSocial impacts: Global warming can also exacerbate social and political issues, such as conflict over resources and migration due to environmental degradation and changes.\n\nGlobal warming is a significant threat to the planet and all of its inhabitants. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adopting sustainable practices are critical steps in mitigating these impacts and preserving the planet for future generations.\n\n\n\nCountries are developing at different rates all around. In terms of developement we can take a look at the countries witht the highest rates of growth in 2018 to see where they fall in terms of emmissions.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/global_development/global_development.csv')\n\n# Select the columns of interest\ntelephone_data = df[['Country', 'Data.Rural Development.Rural Population Growth']]\n\n# Drop rows with missing data\ntelephone_data = telephone_data.dropna()\n\n# Filter out the row with country name \"World\"\ntelephone_data = telephone_data[telephone_data['Country'] != 'World']\n\n# Sort the data by number of telephone lines\ntelephone_data = telephone_data.sort_values(by='Data.Rural Development.Rural Population Growth', ascending=False)\n\n# Select the top 10 countries\ntop10 = telephone_data.head(10)\n\n# Create the bar chart\nplt.bar(top10['Country'], top10['Data.Rural Development.Rural Population Growth'])\nplt.title('Most Rural Developement Growth')\nplt.xlabel('Country')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Growth')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of CO2 emissions, here are the latest estimates from the World Bank for each of the countries you mentioned (data from 2018):\n\nUnited Arab Emirates: 204.2 metric tons of CO2 per capita\nLiberia: 0.2 metric tons of CO2 per capita\nQatar: 36.0 metric tons of CO2 per capita\nRwanda: 0.1 metric tons of CO2 per capita As you can see, there is a wide range of CO2 emissions levels among these countries, with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar having much higher levels of emissions compared to Liberia and Rwanda.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates and Qatar, for example, are both high-income countries with strong economies based on oil and gas exports, while Liberia and Rwanda are classified as lower-middle-income countries with growing economies and improving standards of living.\nLiberia and Rwanda are developing countries, and as such, they may not have the same level of technological advancement as more developed countries. However, both countries have made significant strides in recent years in terms of technology and innovation.\nRwanda, in particular, has emerged as a leader in technology on the African continent. The country has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at promoting technological development, including investments in infrastructure, the establishment of innovation hubs, and the expansion of mobile and internet connectivity. Rwanda has also been a pioneer in the use of drones for various applications, such as medical supply delivery and agricultural monitoring.\nLiberia has also made progress in adopting and using technology, though it faces significant challenges related to infrastructure and connectivity. The government has launched initiatives aimed at expanding internet access and promoting innovation, and there are a growing number of startups and tech companies operating in the country.\nOverall, while Liberia and Rwanda may not be as technologically advanced as some other countries, they are actively working to build their technology sectors and are making notable progress in this area. The question is, if countries like these who currently produce low emmissions were to catch up then produce as much as say Quartar, then this can make the emmission problem even worse.\n\n\n\nAs we saw fron the bar plots above, we can expect China, United States, and India to have the highest emmissions. Lets look at this on an actual map. We can look at the image below to see where the highest emmissions are coming from.\n\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the world map shapefile\nworld = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))\n\n# Load the emissions data and clean it up\nurl = 'https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/global_emissions/global_emissions.csv'\nemissions = pd.read_csv(url)\nemissions = emissions[emissions['Year'] == 2018]\nemissions = emissions[emissions['Emissions.Production.CO2.Total'].notna()]\nemissions['Country.Name'] = emissions['Country.Name'].replace('United States', 'United States of America')\n\n# Join the emissions data with the world map\nmerged = world.merge(emissions, how='left', left_on='name', right_on='Country.Name')\n\n# Plot the map\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))\nax.set_title('Total CO2 Emissions, 2018')\n\nmerged.plot(column='Emissions.Production.CO2.Total', cmap='OrRd', legend=True, ax=ax)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nIn comparison, we can look at the same world map, but highlight wich countries have the highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP per capita). This is directly tied to wealth, which can also be tied to technology advancemnt as I will later show. This image is interactive so you can click on each outlined area to see the dollar amount for reference.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Read the CSV file into a pandas dataframe\ndf = pd.read_csv('/home/jovyan/dgtHum_pythonClass/countries of the world.csv')\n\n# Define a color scale with better colors\ncolors = ['#d1eeea', '#a8dbd9', '#85c4c9', '#68abb8', '#4f90a6', '#3b738f', '#2a5674', '#1d3f5c', '#152935']\n\n# Create a choropleth map using plotly express\nfig = px.choropleth(df, \n                    locations='Country', \n                    locationmode='country names', \n                    color='GDP ($ per capita)', \n                    range_color=[df['GDP ($ per capita)'].min(), df['GDP ($ per capita)'].max()], \n                    title='GDP ($ per capita) by Country',\n                    color_continuous_scale=colors)\n\n# Show the figure\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nWealth and emmissions are also directly linked to technology. In the next image, you can see the contours are very similar to the last two images. Since technology is hard to quantify, one source of technology which is easy to map is the numper of phone lines per 100 people.\n\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the world map shapefile\nworld = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))\n\n# Load the telephone lines data and clean it up\nurl = 'https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/global_development/global_development.csv'\ntelephone_lines = pd.read_csv(url)\ntelephone_lines = telephone_lines[['Country', 'Data.Infrastructure.Telephone Lines per 100 People']]\ntelephone_lines = telephone_lines.rename(columns={'Country': 'name', 'Data.Infrastructure.Telephone Lines per 100 People': 'telephone_lines'})\ntelephone_lines['name'] = telephone_lines['name'].replace('United States', 'United States of America')\n\n# Join the telephone lines data with the world map\nmerged = world.merge(telephone_lines, how='left', on='name')\n\n# Plot the map\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))\nax.set_title('Telephone Lines per 100 People')\n\nmerged.plot(column='telephone_lines', cmap='YlGnBu', legend=True, ax=ax)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nSince all three contours are very similar it is safe to assume their relations to one another. Countries with the most wealth spend more money on technology and developemen, which in turn has a larger production of CO2 emmissions.\nFirst-world countries tend to have higher per capita CO2 emissions than third-world countries because they have more advanced and energy-intensive economies. These countries often have higher levels of industrialization and consumption patterns that require more energy. They also tend to have larger and more energy-intensive transportation systems, such as highways and airports.\nThird-world countries tend to have lower levels of CO2 emissions per capita due to their less advanced economies and limited access to modern technologies. However, as these countries continue to develop, their demand for energy will also increase, and their CO2 emissions will likely rise.\nWhile first-world countries have historically contributed more to global CO2 emissions, the impact of these emissions is felt globally, and it is critical for all countries to work towards reducing their carbon footprint. So what happens when developing countries catch up? Even though the leading countries in emmissions are working hard to find more carbon feiendly technology, they are not changing at a rate fast enough to allow for developing countries to advance.\n\n\n\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a major contributor to global climate change Wealthier countries are responsible for producing higher levels of these emissions than their less wealthy counterparts. This is due in large part to the technological advancements that wealthier nations have been able to make. While technology has certainly brought many benefits to society, it has also resulted in the production of more CO2 emissions, which negatively impacts poorer countries in a number of ways.\nFirstly, CO2 emissions are a leading cause of global climate change. The negative effects of climate change are felt disproportionately by poorer countries, which are often located in areas that are most vulnerable to climate-related events such as flooding, droughts, and hurricanes. These countries also tend to have less infrastructure and resources to cope with the aftermath of such events, which can lead to widespread poverty and displacement.\nPoorer countries often lack the technological resources necessary to produce goods and services in a way that is environmentally sustainable. This means that when wealthier countries demand products from these poorer countries, the environmental cost of producing those goods is often transferred to the poorer countries. This further exacerbates the inequality between rich and poor countries.\nIf more countries were to develop and produce as much as wealthy countries are now, the negative impact on the environment would be catastrophic. Climate change would accelerate, leading to widespread ecological devastation and endangering the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world. In addition, the depletion of natural resources would accelerate, leading to the degradation of ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity.\nAt some point, there may be a choice to be made between development and the environment. However, this need not be an either/or choice. It is possible to promote economic development while also reducing carbon emissions and protecting the environment. This requires a concerted effort on the part of governments, businesses, and individuals to adopt environmentally sustainable practices and technologies. It also requires wealthier countries to take responsibility for their past and current emissions and to assist poorer countries in developing sustainable economies.\nOverall, CO2 emissions are higher in wealthier countries due to technological development, which negatively impacts poorer countries through climate change and unsustainable production practices. If more countries were to develop as much as wealthy countries are now, the consequences for the environment and human society would be dire. However, there is still time to choose a different path and promote sustainable development that benefits all people while also protecting the planet."
